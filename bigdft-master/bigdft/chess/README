Minimal compilation and linking instructions for CheSS
======================================================

1) Download and unpack the latest release of CheSS from Launchpad: https://launchpad.net/chess
   The resulting directory chess-suite will from now on be called <src-dir>

2) Create a build directory, which from now on will be called <build-dir>. Change to this directory.

3) Launch the following command and follow the instructions on the screen:
   <src-dir>/Installer.py build chess -v -c FC="<fc>" CC="gc" FCFLAGS="<fcflags>" --with-ext-linalg="<blas-lapack>"

   You must adapt this according to your system:
   <fc>: Your Fortran MPI compiler (e.g. mpifort)
   <gc>: Your C compiler (e.g. gcc)
   <fcflags>: Your Fortran compilation flags (e.g. -O2)
   <blas-lapack>: The linking line to your BLAS and LAPACK libraries (e.g. -llapack -lblas)

4) The installation will create the following directories:
   <build-dir>/install/lib/: Contains the libraries with which you can link
   <build-dir>/install/include/: Contains the .mod files that you need to interface CheSS with another code

5) To check whether the installation has been successful, you can launch some tests:
   cd <build-dir>/chess/tests ; make check
   
   If you wish to perform these tests in parallel, set the corresponding environment variable:
   export run_parallel='<mpirun>'
   
   Again you must adapt this to your system:
   <mpirun>: Your command to run MPI jobs (e.g. mpirun -np 4)
