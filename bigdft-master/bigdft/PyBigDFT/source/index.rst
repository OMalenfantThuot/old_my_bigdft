Welcome to PyBigDFT's documentation!
====================================

This package is a collection of Python Modules that are conceived for pre- and post- processing
of BigDFT input and output files. Such modules are supposed to enhance the BigDFT experience
by high-level approach.
Also, calculators and workflows are supposed to be created and inspected with modules of the PyBigDFT package.
